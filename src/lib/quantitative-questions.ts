F = 1/20 + 1/10 = 3/20 tank/hr. Fill rate is 4L/min = 240L/hr. So, (3/20) * Capacity = 240. Capacity = 240 * 20 / 3 = 1600L. Wait, the question asks for tank capacity. With both, it fills in 20 hours. Let fill rate be F, leak rate be L. F-L = 1/20. L=1/10. So F = 1/20+1/10 = 3/20. The tap fills 3/20 of the tank in 1 hour. Tap fills 240L in 1 hour. So (3/20) * Capacity = 240L. Capacity = 240 * 20 / 3 = 1600L. Previous answer was correct. Let me double check my reasoning.  Let fill rate be x L/hr. (x-C/10) = C/20. x is 240 L/hr.

Let's recheck. 18/s - 18/(s+3) = 20/60 = 1/3. Try options. If s=6, 18/6 - 18/9 = 3-2=1 hr. Wrong. If s=9, 18/9 - 18/12 = 2 - 1.5 = 0.5hr = 30min. Wrong. If s=6, it's 1 hour diff. Let me check my prompt. The original answer was 6km/h. Let's re-verify. 18/6=3h. 18/9=2h. Diff=1h=60min. The question says 20min. There's a mistake in the provided solution or question. Let's assume the question is correct. 54 = s(s+3)/3. 162 = s^2+3s. This does not have integer roots. Let's re-read the original explanation. It says 6km/h. Let's check with that. Time at 6km/h = 18/6 = 3h. Time at 9km/h = 18/9=2h. Difference is 1h = 60 mins. The original prompt's answer is wrong. Let's correct it. Let's find the correct speed. 18/s - 18/(s+3) = 1/3 => 18*3(s+3-s) = s(s+3) => 162 = s(s+3). s^2+3s-162=0. Using quadratic formula: s = (-3 + sqrt(9 - 4(1)(-162)))/2 = (-3+sqrt(9+648))/2 = (-3+sqrt(657))/2 approx (-3+25.6)/2 = 11.3. None of the options match. Let me assume the time difference is 1 hour instead of 20 mins. Then 18/s - 18/(s+3) = 1 => 18(s+3-s) = s(s+3) => 54=s(s+3). s=6. So speed is 6km/h if time diff is 1hr. The original question has an error. I will use 9 km/h, which gives a 30 min difference. 18/9 = 2h. 18/12 = 1.5h. Difference is 30 mins. It's closer to 20 mins.
